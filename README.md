We revisit the issue of gender imbalance at major UK festivals

In May 2022 we revisited the UK festival scene to look at the gender imbalance among headline performers.

When we first carried out the research in 2017, the Shared Data Unit found 80% of the bill-topping acts at major festivals between the mid-1980s and that year had been male.

In 2022 we teamed up with Radio 1's Newsbeat and wanted to take a slightly different approach - focussing not just on the top ten festivals in the UK, but the top 50.

The findings showed that little had changed despite a series of major campaigns to improve the split of main stage performers at the summer events.

# What we found

- Only 13% of performers were found to be a female solo act or all-female band. 

- While there was a small proportion of mixed-gender acts and one non-binary performer, all-male bands and solo artists occupied three quarters of the top billings.

- Half of all the festivals in the study had no female headliners on the bill.

US singer Maggie Rogers, whose hits include ‘Give a Little’ and ‘Alaska’, said the lack of female representation at festivals continued to be “horrifying” and urged festival directors to be bolder in their choice of headliners.

And Brit Award winner Kate Nash said she was frustrated many continued to argue that it was difficult to book female acts in the top slots.

However, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) Paul Reed said it was unfair to blame the lack of balance on festival directors alone.

He said inequalities ran throughout the ‘talent pipeline’ and had as much to do with booking agents, promoters, music schools and gig operators’.

# Methodology

This was a manual study which looked at the headings used on festival posters across the UK. We chose the 50 festivals to use in our study from [this](https://yougov.co.uk/ratings/entertainment/popularity/music-festivals/all) YouGov poll and logged the name, ages, gender and career length of every act in the largest font on each festival poster. More on the methodology, background and findings can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQyWH-GGbteQfiBRf3RrFjiVGiJ03EdTnQy2SpSAET8/edit?usp=sharing). 

Data
We produced [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FcRk9ZtD22UrojQ00lCn-Mk_lmnE36qj398vIced43E/edit?usp=sharing) dataset with the details of every headline act at 50 festivals across the country as well as the event's location and capacity.  

# Partner usage
